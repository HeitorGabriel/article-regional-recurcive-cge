To run the model in GAMS program, put this three files in the same directory address. The run generates a "results.gdx" file to compare with author's results.

1) "model.gms" description of the model;
2) "samPrinc.gdx" Social Accounting Matrix with Ceará's data to apply in the model;
3) "author_result.gdx" results file used in article.

To run the Kuznets Curve source file to R, you need to download the microdata files of the National Household Sample Survey, in Annual frequence:
http://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Trabalho_e_Rendimento/Pesquisa_Nacional_por_Amostra_de_Domicilios_anual/microdados/
Then, modify to our directory address and the names of the files as in code, to correct importation of the data.

4) "educational_kuznets.R" source file to run in R.
